# Analyze A/B Results

Udacity Data Analytics Nanodegree December 2017 - May 2018. Project 4: Analyze A/B Results 

# Project Details
For this project, I will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. in this project the company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who convert, meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company products. The goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
